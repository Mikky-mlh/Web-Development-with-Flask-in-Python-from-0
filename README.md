# 🐍 Flask Web Dev: My Python-to-Web Learning Journey

## 📝 Hello & Welcome!

This repository is the next big step: diving into **Flask**!

This is where I'm logging my entire process—from setting up the first virtual environment to building fully functional web applications and APIs. Think of it as my **personal, structured course log**.

If you're also making the jump from Python scripting to web development, I hope this repository helps you follow along!

## 🎯 My Focus & Goals

The ultimate goal here is to confidently master the core components of Flask to prepare for my cloud-native course! Specifically, I'm aiming to:

1.  Understand the micro-framework concept and how to properly structure a Flask project.
2.  Master routing, handling requests (GET/POST), and building dynamic frontends with **Jinja templating**.
3.  Integrate a database (like **SQLite** or **PostgreSQL**) using an ORM like **SQLAlchemy**.
4.  Implement user features like authentication (login/registration).
